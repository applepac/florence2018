    <h5> Trump Model: The first day we arrived in Florence there was an anti-Trump parade (see man giving speech photo). People were holding banners and flags. Emotions were intense. <br>
    
   A month later I found this lovely Trump model at an ordinary clothes shop. By mocking at its human inspiration, the model expresses dissatisfaction as well as takes out some despairing anger from the unpleasant situation.
