<h2>A Thousand Years</h2>

<p>
Heart beats fast </p> <p>
Colors and promises</p> <p>
How to be brave</p> <p>
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall</p> <p>
But watching you stand alone</p> <p>
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow</p> <p>

One step closer</p> <p>

I have died everyday, waiting for you</p> <p>
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years</p> <p>
I'll love you for a thousand more</p> <p>

Time stands still</p> <p>
Beauty in all she is</p> <p>
I will be brave</p> <p>
I will not let anything, take away</p> <p>
What's standing in front of me</p> <p>
Every breath, every hour has come to this</p> <p>

One step closer</p> <p>
