      Here's a sticker tourists can buy from vendors at a
      reasonable price. Probably around $1. It should be reusable.

      Vendors won't talk to people with the sticker on, in the interest of saving time and energy. These people are very determined not to buy anything.

      Statistically, vendors might make more money - people who would buy the stickers are unlikely to buy anything even if they were approached aggressively.

      By selling stickers, vendors open up unexplored market, targetting at those who have zero chance of buying.
    </h5>
      
    <h5 id = "line22"
      data-15400 = "opacity:0;"

      The "service" offered by stickers is the passive act of not approaching, which costs vendors nothing, and enables them with more free time to approach tourists who are indeed interested in buying.
    </h5>
    
    <h5 id = "line23"
      data-15900 = "opacity:0;"

      Tourists on the other hand pay a small price for an undisturbed experience, which is priceless.
    </h5>

      data-16400 = "opacity:0;"
      data-16600 = "opacity:1;"

    >
      In conclusion, the sticker system would initiate a real win-win situation by freeing the constrained potential in both seller and buyer's market.
    </h5>
    
    <h5 id = "line25"
      data-16900 = "opacity:0;"
      data-17100 = "opacity:1;"
      data-17300 = "opacity:1;"
      data-17500 = "opacity:0;"
    >
      Moreover, behavioral-sociology-wise, an commual rule among vendors would quickly form, and vendors who still approach sticker-wearers will be punished by the community.
    </h5>
    
    <h5 id = "line26"
    data-17500 = "opacity:0;"

      Looks like the sticker system is beneficial and self-sustaining!
