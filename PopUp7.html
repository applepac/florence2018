    <h5> The night of July 11th, every car in Zadar was blaring, and happy guys on top of their car with Croatian/Slavic flags posed for every passerby. Rejoicing people invited us to take selfies. Police officers calmly and lovingly watched 20-something young men cheering (and sometimes smashing beer bottles). The city celebrated until 3. The next morning, Zadar went back to the clean, calm seaside town again. <br>
    An average Croatian young adult speaks four languages in near-perfection (English, German, Italian, Croatian). There seemed to be a dearly cherished yet long repressed national identity in people. They won (metaphorically), but people took the victory as their personal catharsis.
