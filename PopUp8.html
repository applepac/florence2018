    <h5> The Church of St. Donatus was built in 15th century when Croatia struggled for an independent identity in the middle of big powers like Venice and Austria. People now gather around the building to watch the Â¼ final against England. They won. That night our waiter/ former football player said it was his first time feeling proud of being a Croatian man, in 32 years. He happily offered us wine, went cheering, and left his POS machine on our table.
