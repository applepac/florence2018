    <h5> Cow model. This anthropomorphic and playful cow takes up much space at the entrance, so it probably exists for a good reason. Yet the advertisement might be counter-effective as it supposedly reminds consumers that 1) animals are kind of human-like 2) real animals are being sacrificed for the burger. I was less tempted to eat burger for lunch after seeing the happy cow. <br> I was confused by 1) why it was there 2) why might the ad be effective on others and 3) if anything is wrong with how I process the information.
