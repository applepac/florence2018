    <h5> (Unwillingly) anonymous celebrity. The timeworn marble figure was once made for a high-status person to memorize his posthumous yet eternal fame/glory/virtue. Strangely he liked the idea of people walking on top of his symbolic body and actual remains, which, through the act of establishing this tomb, he seemed to care about. Sadly the individual identity was abraded by time, and the vanity to be seen/admire denied.
